Certainly! Here's an example of a simplified `package.json` file for your Node.js project:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Description of your project",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "axios": "^0.24.0"
    // Add any other dependencies you may have
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=10.0.0"
  }
}
```

Explanation:

- **name**: Your project's name.

- **version**: Initial version of your project.

- **description**: A brief description of your project.

- **main**: Entry point for your application, in this case, `server.js`.

- **scripts**: Custom scripts you can run using `npm`.

  - `"start": "node server.js"`: The command to start your server.

- **dependencies**: List of packages required for your project.

  - `"express": "^4.17.1"`: Web framework for Node.js.
  
  - `"axios": "^0.24.0"`: HTTP client for making requests.

- **devDependencies**: Packages needed only for development (not needed for running the application).

- **engines**: Specifies the version of Node.js your project is compatible with.

You might need to adjust the dependencies based on your project's specific requirements. To install the dependencies listed in your `package.json`, run `npm install`.
